\subsection{Transactional Causal Consistency} \label{ss:tcc}

FaaSTCC~\cite{FaaSTCC:Middleware2021}:
``TCC combines the following guarantees: Transactions read from a causally consistent snapshot,
which represents a view of the data store that includes the effects of all transactions that causally precede it;
A transaction updating multiple objects respects atomicity, i.e., all updates occur and are made visible simultaneously,
or none does. Applying updates in this fashion creates a new causally consistent snapshot of the store.''
``TCC is weaker than SI and allows concurrent transactions to write on the same set of keys.''
